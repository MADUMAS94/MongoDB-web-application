This project was created for CS240 Client/Server Development at SNHU.

For this project we were tasked with creating a web application with MongoDB to store and pull data. To do this information from the Austin animal 
shelter was used. The goal of the project was to display the information from the shelter in an organized and logical manner. Specific tasks were assigned.
where we designed a way for users to filter the information by animal type and display the selected animalâ€™s location on the map with an included tool tip. 
CRUD functions were also written by me and utilized to access the database.
